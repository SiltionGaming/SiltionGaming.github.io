There ends up being too much breading and not enough pickle. When I eat deep fried pickles, I want to taste the saltiness of the pickles.  These deep fried pickles subscribe to the more pickles, less breading style. It uses dill pickle spears (instead of slices) that are coated in a special seasoning and panko before being deep fried.  Served with sriracha ranch dipping sauce that has a slow burn, you’ll never want to eat restaurant fried dill pickles again."

Every culture developed some version of pickling, or preserving in a salty brine or vinegar. Herbs and spices, such as mustard seed, garlic, cinnamon or cloves, were often added, not only for their flavor, but because they helped with the preservation process. If the food being preserved had a high enough water content, it could be packed in salt alone. Salt pork and salt beef were staples of a sailor’s diet before steam engines made ocean crossings much less time-consuming."

                        On this place was a black disk. I asked the waitress what on earth it was, and she smiled; she’d had this question before: “It’s a pickled walnut. It’s good with the cheddar.”         
                        I followed her advice and stabbed the disk with my fork, adding a bit of cheddar cheese and a bit of cold roast beef to round things out. Wow.

                        I could have eaten them from the jar happily all day long, but alas, these were a truly coveted treat,  usually reserved for big family dinners along with a wild duck or a beautiful venison roast. Now that I’ve taken on the canning and preserving role that my Grandmother did for so many years, I understand why they weren’t simply a snack for hungry children’s bellies and I was shooed out to the garden to find something else."

Juiced, sliced or zested, the zing lemon brings to any dish has been appreciated for centuries.

                        Lest pickling lemons seem like an innovation, the practice of preserving lemons by brining is a longtime staple in Indian and Moroccan cuisine and is an anchor of many traditional recipes, most notably used in tagines. The minced rind of preserved lemons can be used in almost as many ways as the lemon itself. The unusual sweet and salty citrus of preserved lemon can be used to brighten soups, stews, sauces, stir-frys, salads or in marinades for fish, chicken or beef."

                    </div>
                    <p class="methods-desc">Produce being pickled is cleaned, trimmed, and cut or left whole. In some cases, it’s cooked or blanched to preserve colour. Produce is packed in jars, then jars are filled with a heated pickling liquid (usually made up of some kind of vinegar, spices, sugar, and salt).
                        <p><i>Works well with: cucumbers, carrots, cauliflower, hot peppers, sweet peppers, green beans, cherries, crab apples, beans</i></p>
                    </p>

                        <span class="methods-titles">~Salt (Dry or Brined)~</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="methods-desc">Produce that benefits from having some liquid drawn out before pickling is ideal for this method. Produce is cleaned, trimmed, cut, and tossed with salt or submerged in a salt brine for a few hours to a day. Produce is then rinsed, drained, and packed as in the quick pickling method. The salt draws out liquid from the produce, which creates more space for the pickling liquid.
                        <p><i>Works well with: cucumbers, zucchini, cabbage, eggplant</i></p>
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="methods-desc">The intention of this method is the same as the salt brined method—to draw out water from produce. Often, this happens in several stages, with soaking in vinegar brine and salt brine over the course of a few days.
                        <p><i>Works well with: watermelon rinds, cucumbers, some other fruits</i></p>

                        <span class="methods-titles">~Fermented~</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="methods-desc">This method is completely different from the previous methods, though a salt water brine is used. Produce is submerged in a salt water brine and left to ferment, often at room temperature. The salt draws liquid out of the produce, and naturally occurring microorganisms digest the sugars. This process forms lactic acid, which lowers the pH and gives a tangy, complex, pickled flavour. Sauerkraut is the classic example of a fermented pickle.
                        <p><i>Works well with: cabbage, cucumbers, peppers (must add vinegar to lower pH), tomatoes, carrots, beans</i></p>
